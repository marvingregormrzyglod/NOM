# The 1st Letter of John

## Chapter 3
⁴ Sin is disobeying God’s law—rejecting His loving boundaries for our good. This rebellion isn’t mere rule-breaking; it’s a heart distrusting His wisdom, fracturing our connection to Him. Yet Jesus, through His sacrifice, offers forgiveness and power to live in harmony with God the Father again.
