  # The Gospel of Matthew

  ## Chapter 6
¹ Be careful not to perform your religious duties in front of others just to be seen and praised by them. If gaining human approval is your primary motivation, you'll receive no reward from God the Father who values sincere hearts above public displays of piety.

² When you give to those in need, don't announce it with trumpets as the hypocrites do in places of worship and on streets. They seek human praise as their full reward, but this temporary recognition cannot compare to God the Father's eternal approval.

³ Instead, when giving to those in need, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing. This metaphor means keeping your generosity so private that you almost forget your own acts of kindness rather than dwelling on them with pride.

⁴ Give in secret where only God the Father sees, and He will reward you openly in His timing and way. This reward may come as inner peace, spiritual growth, or future blessing rather than immediate material prosperity or public recognition.

⁵ When you pray, don't be like hypocrites who love standing in worship places and street corners to be seen praying. They perform for human audiences, missing the true purpose of prayer as intimate communication with God the Father.

⁶ When you pray, go into your private room, close the door, and pray to God the Father who is unseen. He sees what happens in secret places and will reward authentic relationship with Him through answered prayers and spiritual transformation.

⁷ When praying, don't babble with meaningless repetitions like those who don't know God the Father, thinking they'll be heard because of many words. Prayer effectiveness doesn't depend on length or eloquence but on sincerity and alignment with God's will.

⁸ Don't pray like them, for God the Father knows what you need before you ask. Prayer's purpose isn't informing God of needs He's unaware of, but developing relationship with Him and aligning your heart with His perfect purposes.

⁹ Pray like this: "Our Father in heaven, may your name be honored as holy." This acknowledges God's parental love yet sovereign majesty, beginning prayer with worship rather than requests, recognizing His perfect character deserves reverence.

¹⁰ "May your Kingdom come and your will be done on earth as it is in heaven." This expresses desire for God the Father's perfect rule to transform our troubled world, submitting our agenda to His wiser purposes.

¹¹ "Give us today our daily bread." This acknowledges God the Father as provider of all physical and spiritual necessities, teaching dependence on Him for each day's needs rather than anxious stockpiling for uncertain futures.

¹² "Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors." This recognizes our need for forgiveness while committing to extend the same mercy to others who harm us. Receiving God's forgiveness creates obligation to forgive others.

¹³ "Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from the evil one." This humbly admits our vulnerability to spiritual deception and moral failure, seeking God the Father's protection from situations beyond our spiritual strength to resist.

¹⁴ If you forgive others when they sin against you, God the Father will forgive your sins as well. Your treatment of others reveals your true understanding of the mercy you've received and affects your spiritual relationship with God.

¹⁵ But if you refuse to forgive others, God the Father will not forgive your sins. An unforgiving spirit demonstrates you haven't truly grasped your own need for mercy and blocks your ability to experience God's forgiveness fully.

¹⁶ When fasting, don't look somber like hypocrites who disfigure their faces to show others they're fasting. They've received their full reward in human recognition, missing the spiritual benefits that come from genuine self-denial focused on God.

¹⁷ When fasting, comb your hair and wash your face so your fasting isn't obvious to others. This maintains the private nature of spiritual discipline as between you and God the Father rather than as public performance.

¹⁸ Fast in a way that only God the Father, who sees what is done in secret, will notice. He will reward genuine spiritual hunger that seeks Him rather than human approval, with deeper intimacy and spiritual growth through the discipline.

¹⁹ Don't store up treasures on earth where insects and rust destroy, and thieves break in and steal. Material possessions are temporary and vulnerable to loss, providing false security that disappears when economic conditions change or death comes.

²⁰ Instead, store up treasures in heaven where insects and rust cannot destroy, and thieves cannot break in and steal. Eternal investments in God's Kingdom through generosity, service, and spiritual growth yield permanent rewards.

²¹ For wherever your treasure is located, there your heart will be also. Your financial priorities reveal and reinforce your deepest values and loves, either tying your affections to temporary earthly concerns or eter

  ## Chapter 18
¹ The followers gathered around Jesus, eager to understand greatness. He motioned to a child, saying, “True honor comes only when you let go of pride, like this little one—trusting God the Father completely, not relying on your own strength or wisdom.”

² Jesus drew the child close. “To enter God’s kingdom, you must start anew—innocent, humble, and open, like this child. Pride builds walls; humility opens doors to grace.”

³ “Unless you unlearn self-sufficiency and let God the Father reshape your heart, you’ll never grasp His love. Salvation begins when you admit you know nothing—and let Him teach you everything.”

⁴ “The greatest in heaven are those who serve quietly, unnoticed. God values inner surrender over outward success. True power lies in kneeling, not climbing.”

⁵ “When you welcome someone overlooked—the poor, the broken—you welcome Me. Love for others is the mirror reflecting your love for God the Father.”

⁶ “But if you harm someone’s faith—mocking their doubts or exploiting their trust—it would be better to drown. God the Father guards the vulnerable; He judges those who wound them.”

⁷ “Temptations will come, but how terrible for anyone who causes them! Sin starts small, like a spark, but can burn a life to ashes. Stay alert.”

⁸ “If your habits trap you in darkness—lust, greed, hatred—cut them off! It’s better to walk free with scars than stay whole but chained to sin.”

⁹ “Even your eyes can lead you astray. Guard what you feed your soul. Holiness isn’t perfection; it’s choosing light, step by step, no matter the cost.”

¹⁰ “Never look down on anyone. God the Father sends His angels to walk beside the least. Heaven sees their worth even when the world ignores them.”

¹¹ “Imagine a shepherd with ¹⁰⁰ sheep. If one wanders, he leaves the ⁹⁹ to rescue it. So God the Father never gives up on you—He chases your heart until you’re home.”

¹² “And when He finds you, heaven rejoices! Your repentance matters more than the pride of those who think they’re already ‘good enough.’ Grace is for the lost, not the self-righteous.”

¹³ “It’s never God the Father’s will for anyone to stay broken. He longs to heal, restore, and call you His child—no matter how far you’ve run.”

¹⁴ “If someone hurts you, don’t gossip. Go to them gently. Win them back, not to shame them, but to free them. Mercy triumphs over judgment.”

¹⁵ “If they refuse, bring others to help—not to gang up, but to reflect God’s love together. Unity softens hearts; isolation hardens them.”

¹⁶ “If they still reject peace, step back. Don’t force reconciliation. Some hearts need time to thaw. Keep praying; love waits without resentment.”

¹⁷ “When you forgive, heaven affirms it. When you withhold grace, you chain yourself to bitterness. Forgiveness isn’t approval—it’s releasing your right to hurt them back.”

¹⁸ “Pray together boldly. God the Father listens when His people agree. Unity in Christ’s name unleashes miracles—not because you’re perfect, but because He is.”

¹⁹ “Where even two or three gather in My name, Jesus is there. Not as a distant judge, but as a friend. Church isn’t a building—it’s hearts knit together by grace.”

²⁰ Peter asked, “How often should I forgive?” Jesus replied, “Not seven times, but seventy times seven. Keep no tally. God’s mercy never runs out—yours shouldn’t either.”

²¹ “God’s kingdom is like a king settling debts. One servant owed millions, but the king forgave it all—an ocean of grace! Yet that same servant refused to forgive a coworker’s small debt.”

²² “The king heard and said, ‘I showed you mercy—why couldn’t you show even a drop?’ If God the Father forgave your infinite debt, how can you withhold forgiveness from others?”

²³ “Unforgiveness traps you in prison. Let go—not because they deserve it, but because Jesus freed you. Bitterness is a poison you drink, hoping they’ll die.”

²⁴ “Heaven’s mercy transforms hearts. If yours remains unchanged, have you truly received it? Grace isn’t a ticket to heaven—it’s the fuel to love like Christ.”

²⁵ “God the Father will hold accountable those who claim His grace but refuse to give it. You’re forgiven—now go forgive. The proof of faith is a heart that overflows.”
