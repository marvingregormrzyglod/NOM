  # The Gospel of Matthew

  ## Chapter 6
¹ Be careful not to perform kind acts for others’ applause—this hollow show robs eternal reward. God the Father sees secret motives; true generosity flows from love, not pride.

² When giving, don’t announce it like actors seeking praise. Compassion done in silence binds you to heaven’s heart.

³ Even your left hand needn’t know your right’s generosity. God values quiet humility—He reshapes souls unnoticed.

⁴ Give, pray, and fast in hiddenness. God the Father, who sees beyond appearances, will honor your authenticity.

⁵ Avoid praying loudly in crowds to impress. Jesus taught: Retreat to solitude; raw, private prayer deepens trust in Him.

⁶ Close the door, speak plainly to God. He’s not dazzled by eloquence but moved by hearts seeking His presence.

⁷ Don’t repeat empty phrases, thinking volume earns answers. The Holy Spirit already knows your needs before you ask.

⁸ Pray like this: “God the Father, may Your name be honored above all. Bring Your kingdom’s peace; align our wills with Yours.”

⁹ “Provide what we need today. Forgive our failures as we release grudges. Guard us from temptation’s traps.”

¹⁰ “For Yours is the eternal power—not wealth or fame.” This prayer anchors you in God’s priorities, not fleeting cravings.

¹¹ If you forgive others’ wrongs, God the Father’s mercy floods your soul. Unforgiveness cages you in darkness.

¹² Fasting isn’t for pity—cleanse your heart, not just your body. Let hunger remind you: True fullness comes from Jesus.

¹³ Don’t hoard money; earthly treasures fade. Invest in heaven’s economy—kindness, justice, and sharing Christ’s hope.

¹⁴ Your heart clings to what you treasure. Fix your passion on Jesus’ eternal kingdom, not temporary distractions.

¹⁵ Life is more than food or clothes. Trust God the Father—He cares for sparrows; how much more for you?

¹⁶ Anxiety adds nothing to your life. Seek His kingdom first; the Holy Spirit will provide what you need daily.

¹⁷ Don’t borrow tomorrow’s troubles. Each moment is a chance to rest in God the Father’s faithful love.

  ## Chapter 18
¹ The followers gathered around Jesus, eager to understand greatness. He motioned to a child, saying, “True honor comes only when you let go of pride, like this little one—trusting God the Father completely, not relying on your own strength or wisdom.”

² Jesus drew the child close. “To enter God’s kingdom, you must start anew—innocent, humble, and open, like this child. Pride builds walls; humility opens doors to grace.”

³ “Unless you unlearn self-sufficiency and let God the Father reshape your heart, you’ll never grasp His love. Salvation begins when you admit you know nothing—and let Him teach you everything.”

⁴ “The greatest in heaven are those who serve quietly, unnoticed. God values inner surrender over outward success. True power lies in kneeling, not climbing.”

⁵ “When you welcome someone overlooked—the poor, the broken—you welcome Me. Love for others is the mirror reflecting your love for God the Father.”

⁶ “But if you harm someone’s faith—mocking their doubts or exploiting their trust—it would be better to drown. God the Father guards the vulnerable; He judges those who wound them.”

⁷ “Temptations will come, but how terrible for anyone who causes them! Sin starts small, like a spark, but can burn a life to ashes. Stay alert.”

⁸ “If your habits trap you in darkness—lust, greed, hatred—cut them off! It’s better to walk free with scars than stay whole but chained to sin.”

⁹ “Even your eyes can lead you astray. Guard what you feed your soul. Holiness isn’t perfection; it’s choosing light, step by step, no matter the cost.”

¹⁰ “Never look down on anyone. God the Father sends His angels to walk beside the least. Heaven sees their worth even when the world ignores them.”

¹¹ “Imagine a shepherd with ¹⁰⁰ sheep. If one wanders, he leaves the ⁹⁹ to rescue it. So God the Father never gives up on you—He chases your heart until you’re home.”

¹² “And when He finds you, heaven rejoices! Your repentance matters more than the pride of those who think they’re already ‘good enough.’ Grace is for the lost, not the self-righteous.”

¹³ “It’s never God the Father’s will for anyone to stay broken. He longs to heal, restore, and call you His child—no matter how far you’ve run.”

¹⁴ “If someone hurts you, don’t gossip. Go to them gently. Win them back, not to shame them, but to free them. Mercy triumphs over judgment.”

¹⁵ “If they refuse, bring others to help—not to gang up, but to reflect God’s love together. Unity softens hearts; isolation hardens them.”

¹⁶ “If they still reject peace, step back. Don’t force reconciliation. Some hearts need time to thaw. Keep praying; love waits without resentment.”

¹⁷ “When you forgive, heaven affirms it. When you withhold grace, you chain yourself to bitterness. Forgiveness isn’t approval—it’s releasing your right to hurt them back.”

¹⁸ “Pray together boldly. God the Father listens when His people agree. Unity in Christ’s name unleashes miracles—not because you’re perfect, but because He is.”

¹⁹ “Where even two or three gather in My name, Jesus is there. Not as a distant judge, but as a friend. Church isn’t a building—it’s hearts knit together by grace.”

²⁰ Peter asked, “How often should I forgive?” Jesus replied, “Not seven times, but seventy times seven. Keep no tally. God’s mercy never runs out—yours shouldn’t either.”

²¹ “God’s kingdom is like a king settling debts. One servant owed millions, but the king forgave it all—an ocean of grace! Yet that same servant refused to forgive a coworker’s small debt.”

²² “The king heard and said, ‘I showed you mercy—why couldn’t you show even a drop?’ If God the Father forgave your infinite debt, how can you withhold forgiveness from others?”

²³ “Unforgiveness traps you in prison. Let go—not because they deserve it, but because Jesus freed you. Bitterness is a poison you drink, hoping they’ll die.”

²⁴ “Heaven’s mercy transforms hearts. If yours remains unchanged, have you truly received it? Grace isn’t a ticket to heaven—it’s the fuel to love like Christ.”

²⁵ “God the Father will hold accountable those who claim His grace but refuse to give it. You’re forgiven—now go forgive. The proof of faith is a heart that overflows.”
