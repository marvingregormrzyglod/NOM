# The Book of John
¹ In the beginning before anything was created, there existed Jesus. Jesus was with God the Father in perfect fellowship, and Jesus was himself fully God. This eternal relationship within God reveals the foundational truth that God exists in community.

² Jesus was present with God the Father in the beginning before time began. Their relationship wasn't created at some point but has always existed in perfect harmony, revealing the eternal nature of Christ before His human incarnation.

³ Through Jesus everything was created; nothing in all existence came into being without Him. The physical universe, spiritual beings, natural laws - all were designed and formed through His creative power working alongside God the Father.

⁴ In Jesus was life itself - the source of all biological and spiritual existence. This life was the light that illuminates humanity's understanding, showing us truth about God the Father and ourselves that we couldn't discover independently.

⁵ This light of Jesus shines persistently in the darkness of human ignorance and evil, and the darkness has never overcome it despite continuous opposition. This ongoing conflict between light and darkness frames the spiritual reality we experience daily.

⁶ God the Father sent a man named John the Baptist with a divine mission. His appearance fulfilled prophecies about a messenger preparing the way for the Messiah, giving credibility to his testimony about Jesus as more than opinion.

⁷ John the Baptist came as a witness testifying about the light of Jesus, so that through his testimony everyone might believe in Jesus. His role was preparatory and supportive, pointing away from himself toward the greater One coming.

⁸ John the Baptist himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to testify about Jesus who is the true light. Even the greatest human messengers are merely reflectors of Christ's glory rather than sources of spiritual illumination themselves.

⁹ The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world. Unlike limited human teachers, Jesus brings universal spiritual illumination accessible to all people regardless of background, though not all choose to receive it.

¹⁰ Jesus was in the world that He himself created, yet the world didn't recognize Him as its Creator. This tragic irony demonstrates humanity's spiritual blindness - rejecting the very One who designed them and sustains their existence.

¹¹ Jesus came to His own people and nation who had been prepared through centuries of prophecy and covenant, yet they rejected Him. Their refusal shows how religious tradition can actually blind people to God's work happening outside their expectations.

¹² Yet to all who received Jesus and believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God the Father. This spiritual adoption transcends natural birth, offering transformed identity and intimate relationship with the Creator of all things.

¹³ These children of God were born not through natural descent or human decision or a husband's will, but born of God the Father. This spiritual rebirth comes entirely from divine initiative, not through heredity, personal achievement, or human relationships.

¹⁴ The Word became human flesh and lived among us. We have seen His glory, glory as of the only Son from God the Father, full of grace and truth. Jesus didn't just appear human but fully experienced our condition while maintaining His divine nature.

¹⁵ John the Baptist testified concerning Jesus, crying out, "This is the one I spoke about when I said, 'He who comes after me in time has surpassed me in rank because He existed before me eternally.'" This paradox points to Jesus' pre-existence.

¹⁶ From Jesus' fullness we have all received grace upon grace. His inexhaustible supply of unmerited favor comes in successive waves, each new blessing building upon previous ones in a continuous flow of divine generosity toward undeserving recipients.

¹⁷ For the law was given through Moses as a temporary and partial revelation, but grace and truth came through Jesus in their fullness. This contrast doesn't oppose law and grace but shows how Jesus completes what the law began.

¹⁸ No one has ever seen God the Father directly in His full essence, but Jesus, the one and only Son who himself is God and is closest to the Father's heart, has made Him known. Jesus perfectly reveals the Father's character and will.

¹⁹ This was John the Baptist's testimony when Jewish leaders sent priests and temple assistants from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?" Their official investigation shows they recognized something significant was happening that demanded explanation from religious authorities.

²⁰ John the Baptist freely admitted and did not deny but openly declared, "I am not the Messiah." His immediate clarification prevented misunderstanding and showed his secure identity without needing titles or prominence for himself.

²¹ They asked him, "Then who are you? Are you Elijah returned?" He said, "I am not." "Are you the Prophet Moses promised?" He answered, "No." These questions reflected specific messianic expectations based on Old Testament prophecies about end-time figures.

²² Finally they said, "Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?" Their persistence shows the importance religious leaders placed on categorizing John within their theological framework.

²³ John the Baptist replied using the words of Isaiah the prophet: "I am a voice shouting in the wilderness, 'Make straight the way for the Lord!'" By quoting Isaiah, John identified himself as the prophesied messenger preparing for Messiah's arrival.

²⁴ Now some Pharisees who had been sent questioned him further, seeking to evaluate his authority. These religious experts were responsible for protecting the Jewish faith from false teachers while anticipating the promised Messiah's coming.

²⁵ They asked him, "Why then do you baptize if you are not the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet? What gives you authority to perform this ritual of spiritual cleansing typically reserved for Gentile converts to Judaism?"

²⁶ John the Baptist answered them, "I baptize with water for repentance. But among you stands one you do not know. My ritual points to the need for spiritual cleansing, but a greater purification is coming through One already present."

²⁷ Jesus is the one who comes after me, whose sandal straps I am not worthy to untie." This expression of extreme humility showed John recognized the infinite qualitative difference between himself as messenger and Jesus as divine Lord.

²⁸ This all happened at Bethany on the eastern side of the Jordan River, where John the Baptist was baptizing. This geographical detail confirms the historical reality of these events and provides context for understanding the public nature of John's ministry.

²⁹ The next day John the Baptist saw Jesus coming toward him and said, "Look! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! This identification connected Jesus with the sacrificial system familiar to Jewish hearers while expanding its significance universally.

³⁰ This is the one I meant when I said, 'A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he existed before me.' My entire ministry exists to prepare for Him whose eternal existence preceded my birth though He begins His public work after mine."

³¹ I myself did not know Him as the Messiah previously, but I came baptizing with water so that He might be revealed clearly to Israel. John's baptism created a context where Jesus could be publicly identified as the promised One through divine confirmation.

³² Then John the Baptist testified, "I saw the Holy Spirit descending like a dove from heaven and remaining on Jesus. Unlike temporary prophetic inspiration experienced by others, the Spirit's permanent presence on Jesus indicated His unique anointing and identity.

³³ I wouldn't have known Him except the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'The man on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.'

³⁴ I have seen and testify that this Jesus is the Son of God the Father." John's eyewitness testimony provides crucial evidence of Jesus' divine identity, connecting heavenly confirmation with the earthly ministry about to unfold.

³⁵ The next day John the Baptist was there again with two of his disciples. His consistent presence in the same location allowed for continued testimony and the transition of followers from his preparatory ministry to Jesus' central mission.

³⁶ When John saw Jesus passing by, he said, "Look, the Lamb of God!" His repeated identification emphasized Jesus' sacrificial role and directed his own followers toward the greater One whose ministry would supersede his own preliminary work.

³⁷ When the two disciples heard John say this, they followed Jesus. This transfer of allegiance fulfilled John's purpose of preparing people to become followers of Jesus rather than establishing his own permanent religious movement or school.

³⁸ Jesus turned and saw them following and asked, "What do you want?" They said, "Rabbi" (which means Teacher), "where are you staying?" Their question revealed desire for extended time with Jesus beyond a brief encounter.

³⁹ Jesus told them, "Come and see," and they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was about four in the afternoon. This detailed time reference suggests an eyewitness account of a momentous life-changing encounter.

⁴⁰ Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard what John the Baptist had said and who had followed Jesus. This connection between the Baptist's ministry and Jesus' first disciples shows the effectiveness of John's preparatory work.

⁴¹ The first thing Andrew did was find his brother Simon and tell him, "We have found the Messiah" (which means Christ). Andrew's immediate evangelism demonstrates how encountering Jesus naturally leads to sharing the discovery with those closest to us.

⁴² Andrew brought Simon to Jesus, who looked at him and said, "You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas" (which means Peter). Jesus' renaming reveals His divine insight into Peter's character and future role as a foundational church leader.

⁴³ The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, "Follow me." Unlike the previous followers who sought Jesus through John's testimony, this direct call shows Jesus actively recruiting disciples according to His sovereign choice.

⁴⁴ Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida. This shared hometown created natural connections among the early disciples, showing how Jesus often works through existing relationship networks to build His spiritual family.

⁴⁵ Philip found Nathanael and told him, "We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."

⁴⁶ Nathanael asked skeptically, "Can anything good come from Nazareth?" Philip simply replied, "Come and see." This invitation to personal investigation remains the best response to doubt, offering direct experience rather than mere argument about Jesus.

⁴⁷ When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said, "Here truly is an Israelite in whom there is no deceit." This commendation of Nathanael's honest character showed Jesus' supernatural knowledge of people's hearts before conventional introduction or conversation.

⁴⁸ Nathanael asked, "How do you know me?" Jesus answered, "I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you." This demonstration of divine omniscience convinced Nathanael that Jesus was more than just another religious teacher.

⁴⁹ Then Nathanael declared, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!" His immediate confession showed how Jesus' supernatural knowledge led directly to recognition of His divine identity and messianic role promised throughout Israel's history.

⁵⁰ Jesus said, "You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You will see greater things than that." The initial evidence convincing Nathanael was just the beginning of increasingly powerful demonstrations of Jesus' identity and mission.

⁵¹ Then Jesus promised, "Very truly I tell you, you will see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man." This allusion to Jacob's ladder identified Jesus as the ultimate connection between heaven and earth.
