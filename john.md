# The Book of John

1 In the beginning, Jesus, the embodiment of God's will, was with God the Father and was Himself fully God. Through Him, God's loving and just nature is revealed, inviting us to a personal relationship.  

2 Jesus has always existed alongside God the Father, their relationship unbroken and infinite. This eternal bond demonstrates that love and community are woven into the fabric of reality, inviting humanity to trust in a God who transcends isolation.

3 Everything, from galaxies to your own life, was crafted by the will of Jesus. Nothing exists outside His creative power. This truth dismantles pride; if He holds all things together, even our struggles and gifts find meaning in His sovereign hands.

4 In Jesus resides the spark of eternal life, radiating divine truth that pierces humanity’s spiritual blindness. His light exposes brokenness but also heals, offering clarity to those drowning in doubt or despair. Here is hope: darkness cannot erase His light.

5 Though moral and spiritual shadows loom large in our world, they cannot overpower Jesus’ radiant truth. His light persists, undimmed—a call to walk boldly in grace and confront darkness with love, knowing victory is assured in Him.
