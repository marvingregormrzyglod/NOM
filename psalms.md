  # The Psalms

  ## Psalm 23

¹ The Lord, the Almighty and loving Shepherd, is my guide and provider; because He cares for me, I lack nothing that is truly needed. He watches over me with tender care, ensuring that my soul is nourished, my heart is secure, and my path is clear. No earthly wealth or status could offer the peace and fulfillment that come from His presence.

² He leads me to rest in green pastures, places of abundance and peace, where my soul finds refreshment, and He brings me beside still waters, calm and pure, quenching the thirst of my weary spirit. He does not rush me but invites me to dwell in His peace, restoring my strength as a loving shepherd tends to his flock.

³ He restores my soul when I am weary, lifting me up when I stumble, healing what is broken within me. He leads me on the right path, teaching me to walk in ways that reflect His holiness and love, not for my glory, but for the honor of His name, so that the world may see His goodness in my life.

⁴ Even when I walk through the darkest valley, through trials, suffering, and the shadow of death itself, I will not be afraid, for You, Lord, are with me. Your rod corrects me when I stray, and Your staff guides and protects me, reminding me that I am never alone. In Your presence, fear has no hold.

⁵ You prepare a feast before me, even in the presence of my enemies, showing them that Your favor rests upon me. You anoint my head with oil, marking me as Your own, blessing me with more than I could ask or deserve. My cup overflows with Your goodness, for You are generous beyond measure.

⁶ Surely, Your goodness and unfailing mercy will follow me every day of my life, never leaving me, never failing me. And at the end of my journey, I will dwell in Your house, Lord, forever, resting in the place of eternal joy, where Your love never fades, and my soul is home at last.

## Psalm 36
¹ My heart understands how sin speaks to the wicked person deep inside, telling them to do wrong things. They have no fear of God the Father, which is why they continue making these harmful choices that hurt themselves and others around them.

² These people deceive themselves, thinking their sinful actions will never be discovered or punished by God the Father. They refuse to see how their hatred creates destruction in their lives and communities.

³ Their words spread falsehood and their once-good judgment has disappeared. They've abandoned doing what's right and helping others grow, choosing instead paths that lead themselves and others away from healing and wholeness.

⁴ Even when they should be resting at night, they plot harmful schemes. They commit to walking paths that bring pain, never rejecting what is evil but embracing it fully as their way of life.

⁵ Your faithful love, God the Father, reaches higher than the sky itself. Your unwavering commitment to keep your promises extends beyond what our eyes can see, reminding us of your eternal nature.

⁶ Your justice stands stronger than mountain ranges, and your decisions about right and wrong reach deeper than ocean depths. You care for and sustain both humans and animals with perfect wisdom and abundant provision.

⁷ How precious is your unfailing love, God the Father! All people can find protection under your care, like chicks finding safety beneath their mother's wings during dangerous storms or threats from predators.

⁸ They feast abundantly on the goodness you provide in your house. You let them drink from your river of delights, which represents your Spirit's presence bringing joy and satisfaction nothing else can match.

⁹ For with you, God the Father, is the fountain where all life begins and continues. In your light of truth and revelation, we see light that guides our steps and illuminates our understanding of ourselves and the world.

¹⁰ Continue showing your love to those who truly know you, and maintain your goodness toward those whose hearts are honest. Help them experience your love more deeply so they can share it with others who don't yet know you.

¹¹ Don't let proud people walk over me or push me down with their feet. Don't let wicked hands force me away from following your guidance into places where I might fall into sin and separation from you.

¹² Look at what happened to those who practice evil—they have fallen down and cannot get up again. They've been thrown down and cannot return to their former position because they separated themselves from your life-giving presence.

## Psalm 127

¹ Unless God the Father builds your life, your efforts are pointless—like constructing a house on sand. Anxiety-driven work drains joy. Trust His design; true purpose flows from surrendering to His wisdom, not human hustle.

² Unless Jesus guards your heart, self-reliance will fail. Staying vigilant without Him is exhaustion in disguise. He invites you to rest deeply, knowing His love shields you even in stillness—peace isn’t earned, it’s given.

³ Children are God’s gifts, not achievements. Like arrows shaped by a loving archer, they’re crafted for divine purposes. Parents are stewards, not creators—nurture them in grace, but release outcomes to the Holy Spirit’s guidance.

⁴ A family rooted in Jesus becomes a fortress of hope. Each child, trained in His truth, carries light into darkness. Their impact multiplies beyond your lifetime—kingdom work transcends generations.

⁵ Blessed are those who align with God the Father’s vision. Walk humbly, invest in eternal priorities, and watch ordinary lives become testimonies. In His hands, even weakness becomes a weapon for evangelism.
