  # The Psalms

  ## Psalm 23

¹ The Lord, the Almighty and loving Shepherd, is my guide and provider; because He cares for me, I lack nothing that is truly needed. He watches over me with tender care, ensuring that my soul is nourished, my heart is secure, and my path is clear. No earthly wealth or status could offer the peace and fulfillment that come from His presence.

² He leads me to rest in green pastures, places of abundance and peace, where my soul finds refreshment, and He brings me beside still waters, calm and pure, quenching the thirst of my weary spirit. He does not rush me but invites me to dwell in His peace, restoring my strength as a loving shepherd tends to his flock.

³ He restores my soul when I am weary, lifting me up when I stumble, healing what is broken within me. He leads me on the right path, teaching me to walk in ways that reflect His holiness and love, not for my glory, but for the honor of His name, so that the world may see His goodness in my life.

⁴ Even when I walk through the darkest valley, through trials, suffering, and the shadow of death itself, I will not be afraid, for You, Lord, are with me. Your rod corrects me when I stray, and Your staff guides and protects me, reminding me that I am never alone. In Your presence, fear has no hold.

⁵ You prepare a feast before me, even in the presence of my enemies, showing them that Your favor rests upon me. You anoint my head with oil, marking me as Your own, blessing me with more than I could ask or deserve. My cup overflows with Your goodness, for You are generous beyond measure.

⁶ Surely, Your goodness and unfailing mercy will follow me every day of my life, never leaving me, never failing me. And at the end of my journey, I will dwell in Your house, Lord, forever, resting in the place of eternal joy, where Your love never fades, and my soul is home at last.

## Psalm 36
¹ Sin whispers to the wicked, blinding their hearts. Their pride traps them in lies, refusing God the Father’s truth. Without reverence, they stumble, unaware of Jesus’ light breaking through their self-made darkness.

² They convince themselves their flaws go unseen, clinging to harmful paths. But God the Father sees every hidden motive. Those who mock His grace unknowingly invite emptiness into their souls.

³ Their words twist goodness into chaos, forgetting Jesus’ call to love. When actions lack the Holy Spirit’s wisdom, lives fracture like dry ground thirsting for rain.

⁴ Even in shadows, they plot harm, ignoring God the Father’s voice. Yet His mercy waits, wider than oceans—He alone transforms stubborn hearts into gardens of hope.

⁵ God the Father’s love stretches beyond the heavens; His faithfulness outshines the sun. Jesus’ justice anchors the world, steady as mountains rooted deep in the earth.

⁶ His goodness cradles all life, like air filling every lung. To know Him is to wake from sleep, discovering a feast of grace prepared for the humble.

⁷ How precious is Your love, God the Father! All humanity shelters in Your embrace. Trusting Jesus, we drink freely from rivers of joy that never run dry.

⁸ The Holy Spirit’s light satisfies our deepest hunger, guiding us to share this peace. In His presence, fear melts, and life overflows with purpose.

⁹ For You are life itself, Jesus. Your truth pierces darkness, revealing paths where brokenness finds healing. To follow You is to walk in unending dawn.

¹⁰ Keep us rooted in Your love, God the Father. Protect us from pride’s traps. Let the Holy Spirit’s whispers drown out the world’s noise, drawing others home.

## Psalm 127

¹ Unless God the Father builds your life, your efforts are pointless—like constructing a house on sand. Anxiety-driven work drains joy. Trust His design; true purpose flows from surrendering to His wisdom, not human hustle.

² Unless Jesus guards your heart, self-reliance will fail. Staying vigilant without Him is exhaustion in disguise. He invites you to rest deeply, knowing His love shields you even in stillness—peace isn’t earned, it’s given.

³ Children are God’s gifts, not achievements. Like arrows shaped by a loving archer, they’re crafted for divine purposes. Parents are stewards, not creators—nurture them in grace, but release outcomes to the Holy Spirit’s guidance.

⁴ A family rooted in Jesus becomes a fortress of hope. Each child, trained in His truth, carries light into darkness. Their impact multiplies beyond your lifetime—kingdom work transcends generations.

⁵ Blessed are those who align with God the Father’s vision. Walk humbly, invest in eternal priorities, and watch ordinary lives become testimonies. In His hands, even weakness becomes a weapon for evangelism.
