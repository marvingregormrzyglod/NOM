  # The Psalms

  ## Psalm 127

¹ Unless God the Father builds your life, your efforts are pointless—like constructing a house on sand. Anxiety-driven work drains joy. Trust His design; true purpose flows from surrendering to His wisdom, not human hustle.

² Unless Jesus guards your heart, self-reliance will fail. Staying vigilant without Him is exhaustion in disguise. He invites you to rest deeply, knowing His love shields you even in stillness—peace isn’t earned, it’s given.

³ Children are God’s gifts, not achievements. Like arrows shaped by a loving archer, they’re crafted for divine purposes. Parents are stewards, not creators—nurture them in grace, but release outcomes to the Holy Spirit’s guidance.

⁴ A family rooted in Jesus becomes a fortress of hope. Each child, trained in His truth, carries light into darkness. Their impact multiplies beyond your lifetime—kingdom work transcends generations.

⁵ Blessed are those who align with God the Father’s vision. Walk humbly, invest in eternal priorities, and watch ordinary lives become testimonies. In His hands, even weakness becomes a weapon for evangelism.
