  # The Psalms

  ## Psalm 23

¹ Jesus, my caring Shepherd, ensures I lack nothing good. He provides peace beyond circumstances, inviting all to trust His guidance, for He alone fulfills every need of the heart.

² God the Father gifts rest in life’s chaos, guiding minds to His truth. Like tender grass nourished by streams, He renews weary souls, teaching us to share this hope with others.

³ He redirects wandering hearts to live like Him—merciful and just. Though choices may confuse, His name’s promise reminds: Jesus walks with you, restoring purpose in every step.

⁴ Even in death’s shadow, I fear no harm, for the Holy Spirit’s presence shields me. His truth, a steady staff, comforts doubt, proving God’s love overpowers darkness.

⁵ Jesus prepares grace amid opposition, anointing heads with dignity. His blessings overflow; critics see His goodness in us, drawing them to His endless mercy.

⁶ God’s kindness and the Spirit’s voice will pursue you always. Dwell in Jesus’ presence forever—He is home, safety, and the joy every heart seeks.

## Psalm 36
¹ Sin whispers to the wicked, blinding their hearts. Their pride traps them in lies, refusing God the Father’s truth. Without reverence, they stumble, unaware of Jesus’ light breaking through their self-made darkness.

² They convince themselves their flaws go unseen, clinging to harmful paths. But God the Father sees every hidden motive. Those who mock His grace unknowingly invite emptiness into their souls.

³ Their words twist goodness into chaos, forgetting Jesus’ call to love. When actions lack the Holy Spirit’s wisdom, lives fracture like dry ground thirsting for rain.

⁴ Even in shadows, they plot harm, ignoring God the Father’s voice. Yet His mercy waits, wider than oceans—He alone transforms stubborn hearts into gardens of hope.

⁵ God the Father’s love stretches beyond the heavens; His faithfulness outshines the sun. Jesus’ justice anchors the world, steady as mountains rooted deep in the earth.

⁶ His goodness cradles all life, like air filling every lung. To know Him is to wake from sleep, discovering a feast of grace prepared for the humble.

⁷ How precious is Your love, God the Father! All humanity shelters in Your embrace. Trusting Jesus, we drink freely from rivers of joy that never run dry.

⁸ The Holy Spirit’s light satisfies our deepest hunger, guiding us to share this peace. In His presence, fear melts, and life overflows with purpose.

⁹ For You are life itself, Jesus. Your truth pierces darkness, revealing paths where brokenness finds healing. To follow You is to walk in unending dawn.

¹⁰ Keep us rooted in Your love, God the Father. Protect us from pride’s traps. Let the Holy Spirit’s whispers drown out the world’s noise, drawing others home.

## Psalm 127

¹ Unless God the Father builds your life, your efforts are pointless—like constructing a house on sand. Anxiety-driven work drains joy. Trust His design; true purpose flows from surrendering to His wisdom, not human hustle.

² Unless Jesus guards your heart, self-reliance will fail. Staying vigilant without Him is exhaustion in disguise. He invites you to rest deeply, knowing His love shields you even in stillness—peace isn’t earned, it’s given.

³ Children are God’s gifts, not achievements. Like arrows shaped by a loving archer, they’re crafted for divine purposes. Parents are stewards, not creators—nurture them in grace, but release outcomes to the Holy Spirit’s guidance.

⁴ A family rooted in Jesus becomes a fortress of hope. Each child, trained in His truth, carries light into darkness. Their impact multiplies beyond your lifetime—kingdom work transcends generations.

⁵ Blessed are those who align with God the Father’s vision. Walk humbly, invest in eternal priorities, and watch ordinary lives become testimonies. In His hands, even weakness becomes a weapon for evangelism.
